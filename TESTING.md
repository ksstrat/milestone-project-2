## **Testing During Development**
While developing, I've manually tested using the following methods:

1. I manually tested each element for appearance and responsiveness by using a VSCode extension called 'Live Server' to start a local server and then testing my project mainly in the Chrome browser.
    
2. I published the page using GitHub Pages and shared the link with friends, including many developers, to test and get feedback.

### ***Manual Testing:***
* To ensure cross-compatibility, I tested the project on four different browsers. The desktop browsers I utilized included:

  1. Chrome
  2. Firefox  
  3. Vivaldi
  4. Safari

* I have always carried out the manual testing with particular attention to the user stories defined in the README.md. This ensures that a user has the best possible experience with the website.
* I utilized the browser's developer tools to simulate various screen sizes and devices, ranging from mobile (320 px in width) to Ultra Wide Screens (4000 px in width)." 
* I also asked several people with different android and iphone mobile phones to test the site as well.
